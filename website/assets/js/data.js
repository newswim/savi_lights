  - Load in products from Shopify, preferably sorted by a collection
  - Obfuscate Shopify API keys using the github environment
  - Manipulate DOM directly by creating template items for each product
          - jQuery is already included so this shouldn't be too painful



More complicated tasks, such as tracking a user's cart and order information
would require a more thorough integration with shopify, and probably using
something like < https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_api >
along with converting our website over to jekyll so that we can use the gem
for deployment among other things.
